User: What is the difference between parametric and nonparametric correlation?

Model: Parametric correlation and nonparametric correlation are two different ways of measuring the relationship between two variables.

Parametric correlation assumes that the data is normally distributed and that the relationship between the two variables is linear. Nonparametric correlation does not make any assumptions about the distribution of the data or the shape of the relationship between the two variables.

Parametric correlation is typically used when the data is normally distributed and the relationship between the two variables is linear. Nonparametric correlation is typically used when the data is not normally distributed or the relationship between the two variables is not linear.

The following table summarizes the key differences between parametric and nonparametric correlation:

| Feature | Parametric correlation | Nonparametric correlation |
|---|---|---|
| Assumptions | Data is normally distributed and the relationship between the two variables is linear | No assumptions about the distribution of the data or the shape of the relationship between the two variables |
| Formula | Pearson's correlation coefficient | Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, Kendall's tau |
| Interpretation | The strength and direction of the linear relationship between the two variables | The strength and direction of the monotonic relationship between the two variables |

Here are some examples of when you would use parametric and nonparametric correlation:

* **Parametric correlation:** You would use parametric correlation if you have data that is normally distributed and you want to measure the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. For example, you could use parametric correlation to measure the relationship between the height and weight of a group of adults.
* **Nonparametric correlation:** You would use nonparametric correlation if you have data that is not normally distributed or if you want to measure the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship between two variables. For example, you could use nonparametric correlation to measure the relationship between the number of years of education and the income of a group of people.

In general, parametric correlation is more powerful than nonparametric correlation. However, nonparametric correlation is more robust to violations of the assumptions of parametric correlation. Therefore, you should choose the type of correlation that is most appropriate for your data and your research goals.

  Also commonly known as “Kendall's tau coefficient”. Kendall's Tau coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assess statistical associations based on the ranks of the data. Kendall rank correlation (non-parametric) is an alternative to Pearson's correlation (parametric) when the data you're working with has failed one or more assumptions of the test. This is also the best alternative to Spearman correlation (non-parametric) when your sample size is small and has many tied ranks. Kendall rank correlation is used to test the similarities in the ordering of data when it is ranked by quantities.

  Assumptions. ... Assumption #1: Your two variables should be measured on an ordinal, interval or ratio scale. Examples of ordinal variables include Likert scales (e.g., a 7-point scale from "strongly agree" through to "strongly disagree"), amongst other ways of ranking categories (e.g., a 3-pont scale explaining how much a customer liked a product, ranging from "Not very much", to "It is OK", to "Yes, a lot"). ...

Note: Spearman's correlation determines the degree to which a relationship is monotonic.

As such, monotonicity is not actually an assumption of Spearman's correlation. However, you would not normally want to pursue a Spearman's correlation to determine the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship when you already know the relationship between your two variables is not monotonic.

User: Text: Fiscal policy and monetary policy are two distinct tools used by governments and central banks to manage the economy.

Fiscal policy refers to the use of government spending and taxation to influence the overall level of economic activity. Governments implement fiscal policy measures by adjusting tax rates, government spending on goods and services, and transfer payments. Expansionary fiscal policy, such as increasing government spending or reducing taxes, aims to stimulate economic growth and increase aggregate demand. On the other hand, contractionary fiscal policy, involving higher taxes or reduced government spending, seeks to slow down the economy and curb inflation.

Monetary policy, on the other hand, involves the management of the money supply and interest rates by a central bank. Central banks use monetary policy tools, such as open market operations, reserve requirements, and discount rates, to influence the availability and cost of credit in the economy. Expansionary monetary policy, like lowering interest rates or increasing the money supply, stimulates borrowing and investment, promoting economic growth. Conversely, contractionary monetary policy, including raising interest rates or reducing the money supply, aims to cool down the economy and control inflation.

Both fiscal and monetary policies play crucial roles in managing the economy. Fiscal policy directly affects government spending and taxation, impacting the aggregate demand and fiscal balance. Monetary policy, by influencing the cost and availability of credit, affects the borrowing costs, investment decisions, and ultimately, aggregate demand. The effectiveness of these policies depends on various factors such as the state of the economy, prevailing inflationary pressures, and policy coordination between fiscal and monetary authorities.

  Fiscal policy that increases aggregate demand directly through an increase in government spending is typically called expansionary or “loose.” By contrast, fiscal policy is often considered contractionary or “tight” if it reduces demand via lower spending. Besides providing goods and services like public safety, highways, or primary education, fiscal policy objectives vary. In the short term, governments may focus on macroeconomic stabilization—for example, expanding spending or cutting taxes to stimulate an ailing economy, or slashing spending or raising taxes to combat rising inflation or to help reduce external vulnerabilities.

  The desire to reduce poverty might lead a low-income country to tilt spending toward primary health care, whereas in an advanced economy, pension reforms might target looming long-term costs related to an aging population. In an oil-producing country, policymakers might aim to better align fiscal policy with broader macroeconomic developments by moderating procyclical spending—both by limiting bursts of spending when oil prices rise and by refraining from painful cuts when they drop. Response to the global crisis. The global crisis that had its roots in the 2007 meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market is a good case study in fiscal policy. The crisis hurt economies around the globe, with financial sector difficulties and flagging confidence hitting private consumption, investment, and international trade (all of which affect output, GDP). Governments responded by trying to boost activity through two channels: automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus—that is, new discretionary spending or tax cuts. Stabilizers go into effect as tax revenues and expenditure levels change and do not depend on specific actions by the government. They operate in relation to the business cycle. For instance, as output slows or falls, the amount of taxes collected declines because corporate profits and taxpayers' incomes fall, particularly under progressive tax structures where higher-income earners fall into higher-tax-rate brackets. Unemployment benefits and other social spending are also designed to rise during a downturn. These cyclical changes make fiscal policy automatically expansionary during downturns and contractionary during upturns. Automatic stabilizers are linked to the size of the government, and tend to be larger in advanced economies. Where stabilizers are larger, there may be less need for stimulus—tax cuts, subsidies, or public works programs—since both approaches help to soften the effects of a downturn. Indeed, during the recent crisis, countries with larger

  The destruction of cities and the decline in culture and economy had long-term consequences for Russia. The country was left behind in terms of economic development, and it took centuries for it to catch up with the rest of Europe. The Mongol-Tatar invasion also had a significant impact on Russia's political development, as it paved the way for the emergence of the centralized Moscow state, which gradually absorbed other principalities and became the dominant power in Russia. Overall, the invasion of Batu Khan had a profound and lasting impact on the history of Russia.

These principalities included Vladimir-Suzdal, Smolensk, Chernigov and Ryazan, the last annexed by the Duchy of Moscow in 1521. Historians have debated the long-term influence of Mongol rule on Rus' society. The Mongols have been blamed for the destruction of Kievan Rus', the breakup of the ancient Rus' nationality into three components and the introduction of the concept of "oriental despotism" into Russia.

  Within twenty years, Batu Khan marched from Mongolia with an army of 200,000 men. One by one, Russian principalities such as Ryazan, Moscow, Vladimir, Suzdal, and Rostov fell to the Batu and his armies. The armies looted and razed the cities, slaughtered the people, and took many as prisoners and slaves. The Mongols eventually captured, sacked, and destroyed Kiev, the symbolic center of Kievan Russia. Only outlying northwesterly principalities such as Novgorod, Pskov, and Smolensk survived the onslaught, though these cities would endure indirect subjugation and become tributaries of the Golden Horde.
The Orthodox Church. With the initial Mongol onslaught, many churches and monasteries were looted and destroyed while countless adherents to the church and scores of clergy were killed; those who survived often were taken prisoner and enslaved (Dmytryshyn, 121). The mere shock of the force and size of the Mongol army was devastating. The distress was just as political and economic in nature as it was social and spiritual. The Mongol forces claimed that they were sent by God, and the Russians believed that the Mongols were indeed sent by God as a punishment for their sins.

Iakubovskii.10 The more recent views advanced by Soviet scholars have not violated the basic generalization that the Mongol conquest of Russia was a historical catastrophe which the great Russian people managed at enormous cost to overcome and overthrow. The possibility that Russia profited from the Mongol conquest by participating in international commerce across. Eurasia under Mongol auspices or that Muscovy borrowed political, military, or fiscal institutions from the Mongols is not entertained within. Soviet scholarship, and never has been. Despite this one-sided interpretation of the effects of the Mongols on. Russia, Soviet orientalists have made enormous contributions to the study of the Mongol Empire and the Golden Horde. Vladimirtsev's monograph on Mongol nomadic feudalism proved seminal.1l Fiefs of people and herds, with their attendant grazing rights, replaced. European fiefs in agricultural land as the basis of vassal relationships. Chinghis Khan was the instrument of the Mongol feudal elite, not of the. Mongol people. Once his wars had accomplished their progressive function of unifying the Mongols, they became detrimental to the Mon- gol masses by wasting their demographic resources on the altar of the greed of the Mongol aristocracy. While Chinghis' leadership skills were not denied, his success was seen not as a function of personal charisma or of the racial qualities of the Mongol "barbarians," but rather, of the socio-economic structure of Mongol society, i.e. feudalism.

Fruit Jam and Jelly: What's the Difference?
Fruit jam and jelly are both delicious ways to enjoy the flavors of fresh fruit. But what exactly is the difference between the two? And which one is better?

Jam
Jam is a spread made from crushed or puréed fruit, sugar, and pectin. Pectin is a natural thickening agent found in the cell walls of fruits and vegetables. When heated, pectin causes the liquid in the fruit to gel, creating a thick, spreadable consistency.

Jam can be made from any type of fruit, but some of the most popular varieties include strawberry, raspberry, blueberry, and grape. Jam can also be flavored with spices, herbs, or other ingredients.

Jelly
Jelly is a clear, translucent spread made from fruit juice, sugar, and pectin. The fruit juice is heated and strained to remove the solids, leaving behind a concentrated liquid. Pectin is then added to the liquid, which causes it to gel.

Jelly is typically made from fruits that have a high juice content, such as grapes, oranges, and lemons. It can also be flavored with spices, herbs, or other ingredients.

Which one is better?
The best fruit spread for you depends on your personal preferences. Jam is thicker and has a more pronounced fruit flavor, while jelly is lighter and has a more subtle flavor. Jelly is also more transparent than jam, making it a good choice for use as a garnish.

Ultimately, the best way to decide which fruit spread you prefer is to try them both and see which one you like best.

Here are some additional tips for choosing the best fruit spread:
Look for fruit spreads that are made with real fruit and sugar. Avoid products that contain high-fructose corn syrup or other artificial sweeteners.
Choose fruit spreads that are low in added sugar.
Check the ingredient list for any allergens or other ingredients that you may be sensitive to.
Store fruit spreads in a cool, dark place.
Use fruit spreads within a few months of opening.

  He also leads culinary tours in San Francisco and Italy. ... Pectin is a natural and commercially produced essential ingredient in preserves, like jellies and jams. Without pectin, jellies and jams won't gel. Pectin is a type of starch, called a heteropolysaccharide, that occurs naturally in the cell walls of fruits and vegetables and gives them structure. When combined with sugar and acid, it is what makes jams and jellies develop a semisolid texture when they cool. Some fruits, like apples and quince, and the rinds, seeds, and membranes of citrus are naturally very high in pectin. Commercial pectins are usually made from citrus rinds.
How to Cook With Pectin. The type of pectin being used will determine how it is added to a recipe. High methoxyl pectin needs to be cooked to a high temperature (220 F) in combination with acid and sugar to form a gel, while low methoxyl pectin can be activated at room temperature. Therefore, HM pectin will be added to the hot fruit mixture early on. LM pectin is often mixed with a little sugar and added to the hot fruit later in the recipe. Liquid pectin is poured into the pot of hot fruit mixture almost at the end of cooking.

  Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall. Pectin is a natural part of the human diet, but does not contribute significantly to nutrition.
It has been used in gentle heavy metal removal from biological systems. Pectin is also used in throat lozenges as a demulcent. In cosmetic products, pectin acts as a stabiliser. Pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and speciality medical adhesives, such as colostomy devices. Sriamornsak revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms, e.g., controlled release systems, gastro-retentive systems, colon-specific delivery systems and mucoadhesive delivery systems, according to its intoxicity and low cost.

  Where can I find pectin? Pectin is found naturally found in plants. It exists primarily in plant cell walls and helps bind cells together. Some fruits and vegetables are more pectin-rich than others. For example, apples, carrots, oranges, grapefruits, and lemons contain more pectin than cherries, grapes, and other small berries with citrus fruits containing the most pectin. These natural sources of pectin are then processed to create the liquid and powdered pectin used in our home kitchens and by the food and medical industries.
Why is pectin important? Pectin in fruits and vegetables helps provides necessary dietary fiber in our diets. This fiber aids in our health and digestion. It's important to note that pectin derived from fruits and used as a thickener for jams, jellies, and other foods does not provide the same dietary fiber as eating whole fruits and vegetable. Additionally, high-sugar jams and jellies should not replace a well-rounded, fiber-rich diet. Manufacturers use pectin in some cosmetics as a safe and natural thickener and binder.

  Foods With Pectin According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, pectin is found in nearly all fruits and vegetables because it's found in the cell walls of all green plants. The richest sources of pectin are found in the peels of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit and passionfruit. The amount of naturally occurring pectin depends on the ripeness of the fruit. Fruits that have just ripened have the highest pectin content and as the fruit continues to ripen, pectin decreases.
A September 1985 study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that of apples, peaches, strawberries and oranges, oranges contained the most pectin. The same study found that of green beans, carrots, tomatoes and potatoes, carrots contained the highest amount of pectin. Other fruits high in pectin include: apples, bananas, peaches, raspberries, blackberries and apricots. Peas, green beans, sweet potatoes and tomatoes also offer a high amount of pectin.

  Bella's clumsiness and outsider status should make her more cautious, but her curiosity tends to overcome any sense of self-preservation. She thinks of it as her job to help her parents and protect her friends, even though it often ends up the other way around. While Bella is quiet, she isn't shy, and has a sarcastic streak when provoked.

  The protagonist of the novel, Bella is a 17-year-old high school junior. She's pale, with brown hair. She's very intelligent and observant, though she's physically rather uncoordinated. Bella cares deeply for those around her and wants them to be happy above all else—this is why the novel opens with Bella moving to Forks, Washington, a town she loathes, to live with Charlie so that her Mom can travel with her new husband. Bella believes she doesn't relate well to other people, so she doesn't expect to fit in in Forks at all.
And as their relationship develops, Bella's devotion to Edward is so strong that she decides she'd like to become a vampire so they can be together forever. Bella again demonstrates her loyalty to both her blood family and the Cullens, her new chosen family, when the vampire James sets his sights on her. In an attempt to protect Edward, the Cullens, and her parents, Bella evades her protectors and is willing to let James kill her if it means keeping everyone she loves safe. Ultimately, Edward saves Bella from James's attack.

  The Pac-12 statement expressed “surprise and disappointment.” Sources said there was a Pac-12 athletic directors meeting Wednesday, and neither UCLA nor USC tipped its hand. One Pac-12 administrator says they couldn't believe the University of California state system would allow the Bruins to bolt and leave its brethren in Berkeley behind. The Big Ten was serious enough about expansion that Warren created a group that one person described as “an expansion subcommittee” of conference administrators to explore adding teams. “Something was going to happen to combat the Texas and Oklahoma move,” one Big Ten source says. Now, the remaining Pac-12 teams are seemingly free agents. Conference media-rights deals normally lock in league members until they expire. The Pac-12's TV deal ends in 2024. If UCLA and USC didn't leave now, they were risking being in the conference under a new, potentially long-term contract. A Power 5 athletic director sums it up best: “If you don't get out ... “Do you destroy another league or merge?” an official asks. And maybe the Big Ten isn't finished expanding. Could a 16-team league be 18 or 20? A half dozen colleges—most of them from the Pac-12—have reached out to the conference with an interest in joining, a source says. Big Ten officials will review and study options, but nothing is expected soon or is imminent. So, fewer than 10 months after Oregon took down Ohio State, after the West beat the East, after two commissioners walked side by side in line, college sports continues to fracture from within. And what of the Alliance? “Well,” says a Big Ten source, “it probably ceases to exist.” Information from SI senior writer Pat Forde was used in this story.

A LAN can be small or large, ranging from a home network with one user to an enterprise network with thousands of users and devices in an office or school. Regardless of size, a LAN's single defining characteristic is that it connects devices that are in a single, limited area. In contrast, a wide area network (WAN) or metropolitan area network (MAN) covers larger geographic areas. Some WANs and MANs connect many LANs together.
A LAN comprises cables, access points, switches, routers, and other components that enable devices to connect to internal servers, web servers, and other LANs via wide area networks. The rise of virtualization has also fueled the development of virtual LANs, which enable network administrators to logically group network nodes and partition their networks without a need for major infrastructure changes. For example, in an office with multiple departments, such as accounting, IT support, and administration, each department's computers could be logically connected to the same switch but segmented to behave as if they are separate.

  Fiscal policy that increases aggregate demand directly through an increase in government spending is typically called expansionary or “loose.” By contrast, fiscal policy is often considered contractionary or “tight” if it reduces demand via lower spending. Besides providing goods and services like public safety, highways, or primary education, fiscal policy objectives vary. In the short term, governments may focus on macroeconomic stabilization—for example, expanding spending or cutting taxes to stimulate an ailing economy, or slashing spending or raising taxes to combat rising inflation or to help reduce external vulnerabilities.

  The desire to reduce poverty might lead a low-income country to tilt spending toward primary health care, whereas in an advanced economy, pension reforms might target looming long-term costs related to an aging population. In an oil-producing country, policymakers might aim to better align fiscal policy with broader macroeconomic developments by moderating procyclical spending—both by limiting bursts of spending when oil prices rise and by refraining from painful cuts when they drop. Response to the global crisis. The global crisis that had its roots in the 2007 meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market is a good case study in fiscal policy. The crisis hurt economies around the globe, with financial sector difficulties and flagging confidence hitting private consumption, investment, and international trade (all of which affect output, GDP). Governments responded by trying to boost activity through two channels: automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus—that is, new discretionary spending or tax cuts. Stabilizers go into effect as tax revenues and expenditure levels change and do not depend on specific actions by the government. They operate in relation to the business cycle. For instance, as output slows or falls, the amount of taxes collected declines because corporate profits and taxpayers' incomes fall, particularly under progressive tax structures where higher-income earners fall into higher-tax-rate brackets. Unemployment benefits and other social spending are also designed to rise during a downturn. These cyclical changes make fiscal policy automatically expansionary during downturns and contractionary during upturns. Automatic stabilizers are linked to the size of the government, and tend to be larger in advanced economies. Where stabilizers are larger, there may be less need for stimulus—tax cuts, subsidies, or public works programs—since both approaches help to soften the effects of a downturn. Indeed, during the recent crisis, countries with larger

  The destruction of cities and the decline in culture and economy had long-term consequences for Russia. The country was left behind in terms of economic development, and it took centuries for it to catch up with the rest of Europe. The Mongol-Tatar invasion also had a significant impact on Russia's political development, as it paved the way for the emergence of the centralized Moscow state, which gradually absorbed other principalities and became the dominant power in Russia. Overall, the invasion of Batu Khan had a profound and lasting impact on the history of Russia.

  Within twenty years, Batu Khan marched from Mongolia with an army of 200,000 men. One by one, Russian principalities such as Ryazan, Moscow, Vladimir, Suzdal, and Rostov fell to the Batu and his armies. The armies looted and razed the cities, slaughtered the people, and took many as prisoners and slaves. The Mongols eventually captured, sacked, and destroyed Kiev, the symbolic center of Kievan Russia. Only outlying northwesterly principalities such as Novgorod, Pskov, and Smolensk survived the onslaught, though these cities would endure indirect subjugation and become tributaries of the Golden Horde.
The Orthodox Church. With the initial Mongol onslaught, many churches and monasteries were looted and destroyed while countless adherents to the church and scores of clergy were killed; those who survived often were taken prisoner and enslaved (Dmytryshyn, 121). The mere shock of the force and size of the Mongol army was devastating. The distress was just as political and economic in nature as it was social and spiritual. The Mongol forces claimed that they were sent by God, and the Russians believed that the Mongols were indeed sent by God as a punishment for their sins.

  He also leads culinary tours in San Francisco and Italy. ... Pectin is a natural and commercially produced essential ingredient in preserves, like jellies and jams. Without pectin, jellies and jams won't gel. Pectin is a type of starch, called a heteropolysaccharide, that occurs naturally in the cell walls of fruits and vegetables and gives them structure. When combined with sugar and acid, it is what makes jams and jellies develop a semisolid texture when they cool. Some fruits, like apples and quince, and the rinds, seeds, and membranes of citrus are naturally very high in pectin. Commercial pectins are usually made from citrus rinds.
How to Cook With Pectin. The type of pectin being used will determine how it is added to a recipe. High methoxyl pectin needs to be cooked to a high temperature (220 F) in combination with acid and sugar to form a gel, while low methoxyl pectin can be activated at room temperature. Therefore, HM pectin will be added to the hot fruit mixture early on. LM pectin is often mixed with a little sugar and added to the hot fruit later in the recipe. Liquid pectin is poured into the pot of hot fruit mixture almost at the end of cooking.

  Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall. Pectin is a natural part of the human diet, but does not contribute significantly to nutrition.
It has been used in gentle heavy metal removal from biological systems. Pectin is also used in throat lozenges as a demulcent. In cosmetic products, pectin acts as a stabiliser. Pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and speciality medical adhesives, such as colostomy devices. Sriamornsak revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms, e.g., controlled release systems, gastro-retentive systems, colon-specific delivery systems and mucoadhesive delivery systems, according to its intoxicity and low cost.

Some fruits and vegetables are more pectin-rich than others. For example, apples, carrots, oranges, grapefruits, and lemons contain more pectin than cherries, grapes, and other small berries with citrus fruits containing the most pectin. These natural sources of pectin are then processed to create the liquid and powdered pectin used in our home kitchens and by the food and medical industries.
Why is pectin important? Pectin in fruits and vegetables helps provides necessary dietary fiber in our diets. This fiber aids in our health and digestion. It's important to note that pectin derived from fruits and used as a thickener for jams, jellies, and other foods does not provide the same dietary fiber as eating whole fruits and vegetable. Additionally, high-sugar jams and jellies should not replace a well-rounded, fiber-rich diet. Manufacturers use pectin in some cosmetics as a safe and natural thickener and binder.

  Foods With Pectin According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, pectin is found in nearly all fruits and vegetables because it's found in the cell walls of all green plants. The richest sources of pectin are found in the peels of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit and passionfruit. The amount of naturally occurring pectin depends on the ripeness of the fruit. Fruits that have just ripened have the highest pectin content and as the fruit continues to ripen, pectin decreases.
A September 1985 study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that of apples, peaches, strawberries and oranges, oranges contained the most pectin. The same study found that of green beans, carrots, tomatoes and potatoes, carrots contained the highest amount of pectin. Other fruits high in pectin include: apples, bananas, peaches, raspberries, blackberries and apricots. Peas, green beans, sweet potatoes and tomatoes also offer a high amount of pectin.

  Bella's clumsiness and outsider status should make her more cautious, but her curiosity tends to overcome any sense of self-preservation. She thinks of it as her job to help her parents and protect her friends, even though it often ends up the other way around. While Bella is quiet, she isn't shy, and has a sarcastic streak when provoked.
Relief that I wasn't the only newcomer here, and certainly not the most interesting by any standard.” Interests… books and music. She likes to be alone. Relationship Status… single, which is good news to the boys of her new school. Bella's more interested in Edward, though. Sadly, he doesn't seem to want to be her classmate, much less her friend. Challenge… getting close to Edward and discovering the Cullens' secrets. Fitting in at her new school isn't easy, either, and it doesn't help that Bella's father is Forks's sheriff. Personality… responsible, quiet, but determined.

  The protagonist of the novel, Bella is a 17-year-old high school junior. She's pale, with brown hair. She's very intelligent and observant, though she's physically rather uncoordinated. Bella cares deeply for those around her and wants them to be happy above all else—this is why the novel opens with Bella moving to Forks, Washington, a town she loathes, to live with Charlie so that her Mom can travel with her new husband. Bella believes she doesn't relate well to other people, so she doesn't expect to fit in in Forks at all.
And as their relationship develops, Bella's devotion to Edward is so strong that she decides she'd like to become a vampire so they can be together forever. Bella again demonstrates her loyalty to both her blood family and the Cullens, her new chosen family, when the vampire James sets his sights on her. In an attempt to protect Edward, the Cullens, and her parents, Bella evades her protectors and is willing to let James kill her if it means keeping everyone she loves safe. Ultimately, Edward saves Bella from James's attack.

Pectin: Pectin is a heteropolysaccharide, a structural acid contained in the primary lamella, in the middle lamella, and in the cell walls of terrestrial plants. The principal, chemical component of pectin is galacturonic acid which was isolated and described by Henri Braconnot in 1825.

[2] [PECTIN: Overview, Uses, Side Effects, Precautions, Interactions, Dosing and Reviews - WebMD](https://www.webmd.com/vitamins/ai/ingredientmono-500/pectin#:~:text=Pectin%20is%20a%20soluble%20fiber,evidence%20to%20support%20these%20uses.)
Pectin is a soluble fiber (polysaccharide) found in fruits. It is used as a thickener in cooking and baking. It is also sometimes used to make medicine. Pectin binds substances in the intestines and adds bulk to the stools. It might also reduce how much cholesterol the body absorbs from foods. People use pectin for high cholesterol, prediabetes, heartburn, diarrhea, and many other conditions, but there is no good scientific evidence to support these uses.
Special Precautions and Warnings. When taken by mouth: Pectin is commonly consumed in food amounts. It is possibly safe when used in larger amounts for up to one year. It's usually well-tolerated. Side effects might include diarrhea, gas, and stomachcramps. Pregnancy and breast-feeding: Pectin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when taken by mouth in larger amounts. Children: Pectin is commonly consumed in foods. It is possibly safe when taken by mouth in larger amounts, short-term. Allergy to cashew: Pectin might cause allergic reactions in people who are allergic to cashew.

[3] [Pectin - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pectin#:~:text=Pectin%20is%20an%20important%20cell,not%20contribute%20significantly%20to%20nutrition.)
Pectin is an important cell wall polysaccharide that allows primary cell wall extension and plant growth. During fruit ripening, pectin is broken down by the enzymes pectinase and pectinesterase, in which process the fruit becomes softer as the middle lamellae break down and cells become separated from each other. A similar process of cell separation caused by the breakdown of pectin occurs in the abscission zone of the petioles of deciduous plants at leaf fall. Pectin is a natural part of the human diet, but does not contribute significantly to nutrition.
It has been used in gentle heavy metal removal from biological systems. Pectin is also used in throat lozenges as a demulcent. In cosmetic products, pectin acts as a stabiliser. Pectin is also used in wound healing preparations and speciality medical adhesives, such as colostomy devices. Sriamornsak revealed that pectin could be used in various oral drug delivery platforms, e.g., controlled release systems, gastro-retentive systems, colon-specific delivery systems and mucoadhesive delivery systems, according to its intoxicity and low cost.

Sources of pectin (soluble fiber)? - Go Ask Alice!

Apples and citrus fruits — such as peaches, oranges, grapefruits, apricots, and lemons — contain the highest amount of pectin among fruits. And among vegetables, carrots, tomatoes, and potatoes are those with the most pectin. Peas have the highest pectin concentration among legumes.

[2] [List of Foods High in Pectin | livestrong](https://www.livestrong.com/article/289067-list-of-foods-high-in-pectin/#:~:text=Foods%20With%20Pectin,continues%20to%20ripen%2C%20pectin%20decreases.)
Foods With Pectin According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, pectin is found in nearly all fruits and vegetables because it's found in the cell walls of all green plants. The richest sources of pectin are found in the peels of citrus fruits such as oranges, lemons, limes, grapefruit and passionfruit. The amount of naturally occurring pectin depends on the ripeness of the fruit. Fruits that have just ripened have the highest pectin content and as the fruit continues to ripen, pectin decreases.
A September 1985 study in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association found that of apples, peaches, strawberries and oranges, oranges contained the most pectin. The same study found that of green beans, carrots, tomatoes and potatoes, carrots contained the highest amount of pectin. Other fruits high in pectin include: apples, bananas, peaches, raspberries, blackberries and apricots. Peas, green beans, sweet potatoes and tomatoes also offer a high amount of pectin.

[3] [Summer Staple – Pectin - Center for Research on Ingredient Safety - MSU College of Agriculture and Natural Resources - Michigan State University](https://www.canr.msu.edu/news/pectin#:~:text=Where%20can%20I%20find%20pectin,the%20food%20and%20medical%20industries.)
Where can I find pectin? Pectin is found naturally found in plants. It exists primarily in plant cell walls and helps bind cells together. Some fruits and vegetables are more pectin-rich than others. For example, apples, carrots, oranges, grapefruits, and lemons contain more pectin than cherries, grapes, and other small berries with citrus fruits containing the most pectin. These natural sources of pectin are then processed to create the liquid and powdered pectin used in our home kitchens and by the food and medical industries.
Why is pectin important? Pectin in fruits and vegetables helps provides necessary dietary fiber in our diets. This fiber aids in our health and digestion. It's important to note that pectin derived from fruits and used as a thickener for jams, jellies, and other foods does not provide the same dietary fiber as eating whole fruits and vegetable. Additionally, high-sugar jams and jellies should not replace a well-rounded, fiber-rich diet. Manufacturers use pectin in some cosmetics as a safe and natural thickener and binder.

Bella Swan - Wikipedia

Bella is described as being petite, with a height of roughly 5'4", and a very translucent, pale complexion. She has thick, long, brown hair, with a wide forehead, and a widow's peak. Her eyes are described as being "chocolate brown" and widely spaced.

[2] [Bella Swan - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bella_Swan#:~:text=glances%20at%20Edward.-,Personality,person%2C%20especially%20for%20her%20age.)
Personality. Bella is described as being clumsy, having a weak constitution, and averse towards physical activity. Bella is also described as reclusive, reticent, insecure, and very sensitive. She also cares for the rest of the Cullen family, her husband, Edward, her daughter, Renesmee, her parents, Charlie and Renée, and her friend, Jacob Black. She has a tendency to underestimate the people around her mainly because of her concerns for their safety. Having learned to take care of her mother over the years and being naturally responsible, Bella had developed into a very mature person, especially for her age.
She is an extremely private person who keeps her thoughts and feelings to herself and hates when someone tries to understand her, which is thought to be why Edward is unable to hear her thoughts. Bella tends to daydream, getting lost in her own little world. She is also known to be incredibly stubborn with herself, because of her determination to become a vampire in order to be with Edward forever. Bella is also said to possess poor acting skills. Ironically, she demonstrates good acting ability in Twilight when she makes her father believe that she has dumped Edward and is leaving Forks.

The protagonist of the novel, Bella is a 17-year-old high school junior. She's pale, with brown hair. She's very intelligent and observant, though she's physically rather uncoordinated. Bella cares deeply for those around her and wants them to be happy above all else—this is why the novel opens with Bella moving to Forks, Washington, a town she loathes, to live with Charlie so that her Mom can travel with her new husband. Bella believes she doesn't relate well to other people, so she doesn't expect to fit in in Forks at all.
And as their relationship develops, Bella's devotion to Edward is so strong that she decides she'd like to become a vampire so they can be together forever. Bella again demonstrates her loyalty to both her blood family and the Cullens, her new chosen family, when the vampire James sets his sights on her. In an attempt to protect Edward, the Cullens, and her parents, Bella evades her protectors and is willing to let James kill her if it means keeping everyone she loves safe. Ultimately, Edward saves Bella from James's attack.

Interpreting the Results for Kendall's Tau-b SPSS Statistics generates one main table for the Kendall's tau-b procedure that you ran in the previous section. If your data passed assumption #2 (i.e., there is a monotonic relationship between your two variables), which we explained earlier in the Assumptions section, you will only need to interpret this one table. However, since you should have tested your data for this assumption, you will also need to interpret the SPSS Statistics output that was produced when you tested for it (i.e., your scatterplot results).

Also commonly known as “Kendall's tau coefficient”. Kendall's Tau coefficient and Spearman's rank correlation coefficient assess statistical associations based on the ranks of the data. Kendall rank correlation (non-parametric) is an alternative to Pearson's correlation (parametric) when the data you're working with has failed one or more assumptions of the test. This is also the best alternative to Spearman correlation (non-parametric) when your sample size is small and has many tied ranks. Kendall rank correlation is used to test the similarities in the ordering of data when it is ranked by quantities.

Examples of ordinal variables include Likert scales (e.g., a 7-point scale from "strongly agree" through to "strongly disagree"), amongst other ways of ranking categories (e.g., a 3-pont scale explaining how much a customer liked a product, ranging from "Not very much", to "It is OK", to "Yes, a lot"). ...

Note: Spearman's correlation determines the degree to which a relationship is monotonic. Put another way, it determines whether there is a monotonic component of association between two continuous or ordinal variables. As such, monotonicity is not actually an assumption of Spearman's correlation. However, you would not normally want to pursue a Spearman's correlation to determine the strength and direction of a monotonic relationship when you already know the relationship between your two variables is not monotonic.

The desire to reduce poverty might lead a low-income country to tilt spending toward primary health care, whereas in an advanced economy, pension reforms might target looming long-term costs related to an aging population. In an oil-producing country, policymakers might aim to better align fiscal policy with broader macroeconomic developments by moderating procyclical spending—both by limiting bursts of spending when oil prices rise and by refraining from painful cuts when they drop. Response to the global crisis. The global crisis that had its roots in the 2007 meltdown in the U.S. mortgage market is a good case study in fiscal policy. The crisis hurt economies around the globe, with financial sector difficulties and flagging confidence hitting private consumption, investment, and international trade (all of which affect output, GDP). Governments responded by trying to boost activity through two channels: automatic stabilizers and fiscal stimulus—that is, new discretionary spending or tax cuts. Stabilizers go into effect as tax revenues and expenditure levels change and do not depend on specific actions by the government. They operate in relation to the business cycle. For instance, as output slows or falls, the amount of taxes collected declines because corporate profits and taxpayers' incomes fall, particularly under progressive tax structures where higher-income earners fall into higher-tax-rate brackets. Unemployment benefits and other social spending are also designed to rise during a downturn. These cyclical changes make fiscal policy automatically expansionary during downturns and contractionary during upturns. Automatic stabilizers are linked to the size of the government, and tend to be larger in advanced economies. Where stabilizers are larger, there may be less need for stimulus—tax cuts, subsidies, or public works programs—since both approaches help to soften the effects of a downturn. Indeed, during the recent crisis, countries with larger

Mongol Influences on the Development of Moscow

The Mongols ruled Russia for 240 years during the 13th to 15th centuries. One of the greatest effects of Mongol rule in Russia was the rise of Moscow as not only the preeminent city in Russia but also the central power of a large and expanding empire.

[2] [The Effects of the Mongol Empire on Russia - GeoHistory](https://geohistory.today/mongol-empire-effects-russia/#:~:text=Within%20twenty%20years%2C%20Batu%20Khan,tributaries%20of%20the%20Golden%20Horde.)
Within twenty years, Batu Khan marched from Mongolia with an army of 200,000 men. One by one, Russian principalities such as Ryazan, Moscow, Vladimir, Suzdal, and Rostov fell to the Batu and his armies. The armies looted and razed the cities, slaughtered the people, and took many as prisoners and slaves. The Mongols eventually captured, sacked, and destroyed Kiev, the symbolic center of Kievan Russia. Only outlying northwesterly principalities such as Novgorod, Pskov, and Smolensk survived the onslaught, though these cities would endure indirect subjugation and become tributaries of the Golden Horde.
In the times after the Mongols had conquered the majority of Kievan Russia, veches ceased to exist in all cities except Novgorod, Pskov, and others in the northwestern regions. Veches in those cities continued to function and develop until Moscow itself subjugated them in the late fifteenth century. However, today the spirit of the veche as a public forum has been revived in several cities across Russia, including especially Novgorod. Of great importance to the Mongol overlords was census tabulation, which allowed for the collection of taxes.

The destruction of cities and the decline in culture and economy had long-term consequences for Russia. The country was left behind in terms of economic development, and it took centuries for it to catch up with the rest of Europe. The Mongol-Tatar invasion also had a significant impact on Russia's political development, as it paved the way for the emergence of the centralized Moscow state, which gradually absorbed other principalities and became the dominant power in Russia. Overall, the invasion of Batu Khan had a profound and lasting impact on the history of Russia.
Influence on society The maximum extent and principalities of Kievan Rus', 1220–1240. These principalities included Vladimir-Suzdal, Smolensk, Chernigov and Ryazan, the last annexed by the Duchy of Moscow in 1521. Historians have debated the long-term influence of Mongol rule on Rus' society. The Mongols have been blamed for the destruction of Kievan Rus', the breakup of the ancient Rus' nationality into three components and the introduction of the concept of "oriental despotism" into Russia. Historians also credit the Mongol regime with an important role in the development of Muscovy as a state.

In most cases both Russian and non-Russian historians have seen the Mongol invasion as a disaster for Russia, one over which the Russian people heroically triumphed (at one end of the historiographical spectrum), or one which led to cultural and political backwardness and slavish oriental despotism (a view shared by many non-Russian writers and Russian Marxists). Soviet writing often managed to adopt both these attitudes at the same time. The facts of the case have been difficult for a non-specialist and non-Russophone reader to assemble and assess. It will now be a little easier.
In the case of the Mongols/Tatars their invasion of Kievan Russia certainly happened (the first Russian defeat at the hands of a marauding Tatar army was in 1223 and in the period 1237-1240 most of Russia was subjugated) and could easily have extended further west if circumstances had been just a little different. And the consequences of the invasion were certainly profound and helped to shape Muscovite and modern Russia, perhaps even its role in recent world history.

Miloš Zeman (Czech: [ˈmɪloʃ ˈzɛman]; born 28 September 1944) is a Czech politician who served as the third president of the Czech Republic and eleventh president since the Czechoslovak declaration of independence from 2013 to 2023. He also previously served as the prime minister of the Czech Republic from 1998 to 2002. As leader of the Czech Social Democratic Party during the 1990s, he is credited with the revival of the party into one of the country's major political forces. Zeman briefly served as the President of the Chamber of Deputies from 1996 to 1998.
Under his leadership, the Czech Republic joined NATO in 1999. Zeman was the last leader to vote in favor of the 1999 bombing of Yugoslavia, effectively green-lighting the operation. He ran for president in 2003 but was eliminated after his own party members did not vote for him. In January 2013, Zeman was elected President of the Czech Republic, a mostly ceremonial figurehead of the parliamentary republic. He is the first directly elected president in Czech history; both of his predecessors, Václav Havel and Václav Klaus, were elected by the Czech Parliament. In 2018, he was re-elected for a second term.

When does summer start? - Met Office

The seasons are defined as spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August), autumn (September, October, November) and winter (December, January, February).

[2] [Summer - Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer#:~:text=The%20meteorological%20convention%20is%20to,year%2C%20in%20which%20daylight%20predominates.)
The meteorological convention is to define summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere and the months of December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere. Under meteorological definitions, all seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a month. This meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year, in which daylight predominates.
Where a seasonal lag of half a season or more is common, reckoning based on astronomical markers is shifted half a season. By this method, in North America, summer is the period from the summer solstice (usually 20 or 21 June in the Northern Hemisphere) to the autumn equinox. Reckoning by cultural festivals, the summer season in the United States is traditionally regarded as beginning on Memorial Day weekend (the last weekend in May) and ending on Labor Day (the first Monday in September), more closely in line with the meteorological definition for the parts of the country that have four-season weather.

However, meteorologists are also interested in the beginning of the meteorological summer. Meteorological summer will always begin on 1 June; ending on 31 August. The meteorological seasons consist of splitting the seasons into four periods made up of three months each. These seasons are split to coincide with our Gregorian calendar, making it easier for meteorological observing and forecasting to compare seasonal and monthly statistics. The seasons are defined as spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August), autumn (September, October, November) and winter (December, January, February).
Astronomical summer The astronomical calendar determines the seasons due to the 23.5 degrees of tilt of the Earth's rotational axis in relation to its orbit around the Sun. Both Equinoxes and Solstices are related to the Earth's orbit around the Sun. This year, astronomical summer began on 21 June 2022 and ended on 23 September 2022.

Drink in moderation — or not at all. Researchers keep studying whether red wine and other alcoholic drinks can help the heart. Those who drink regular, limited amounts of alcohol, including red wine, seem to have a lower risk of heart disease. Drinking regular, limited amounts is called drinking in moderation. But there might be other reasons for the lower risk of heart disease in people who drink red wine in moderation. For instance, they might eat a healthier diet and be more active than those who don't drink red wine. And they might have higher incomes and better access to health care as well.
Resveratrol might be key to what could make red wine heart healthy. Learn the facts and hype about red wine and how it affects the heart. Red wine, in limited amounts, has long been thought of as healthy for the heart. The alcohol and certain substances in red wine called antioxidants may help prevent coronary artery disease, the condition that leads to heart attacks. Links between red wine and fewer heart attacks aren't well understood. But antioxidants in red wine may increase levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, also called the "good" cholesterol, and protect against cholesterol buildup.

Read this before you toast. ... For years, studies have shown a relationship between drinking a moderate amount of red wine and good heart health, but experts say it's important to understand what that means before you prescribe yourself a glass or two a day. No research has established a cause-and-effect link between drinking alcohol and better heart health. Rather, studies have found an association between wine and such benefits as a lower risk of dying from heart disease. It's unclear whether red wine is directly associated with this benefit or whether other factors are at play, said Dr.

However, the evidence that drinking red wine in particular (or alcohol in general, for that matter) can help you avoid heart disease is pretty weak, says Dr. Kenneth Mukamal, an internist at Harvard-affiliated Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. All of the research showing that people who drink moderate amounts of alcohol have lower rates of heart disease is observational. Such studies can't prove cause and effect, only associations. Moderate drinking — defined as one drink per day for healthy women and two drinks per day for healthy men — is widely considered safe.
Resveratrol reservations ... Research in mice is compelling, says Dr. Mukamal. But there's zero evidence of any benefit for people who take resveratrol supplements. And you'd have to drink a hundred to a thousand glasses of red wine daily to get an amount equivalent to the doses that improved health in mice, he says. Also, a 2014 study of older adults living in the Chianti region of Italy, whose diets were naturally rich in resveratrol, found no link between resveratrol levels (measured by a breakdown product in urine samples) and rates of heart disease, cancer, or death.

Some people who drink alcohol have trouble stopping, called addiction. And drinking alcohol can cause other health problems or make them worse.
